            <h3>Technical Skills</h3>
            <p>I possess a diverse technical toolkit centered around modern web development and data analysis. My core competencies include proficiency in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (ES6+), with a strong focus on building responsive interfaces using frameworks like React. On the backend, I am experienced in managing databases and writing efficient logic in languages such as Python or C++. Additionally, I am well-versed in version control using Git and familiar with deploying applications within Cloud environments, ensuring that projects are not only functional but also scalable and secure.</p>

            <h3>Education</h3>
            <p>I am currently pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Data Science (or your specific field), where I have built a rigorous foundation in computational theory and mathematical modeling. My coursework highlights a deep dive into Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), database management, and statistical analysis. Beyond the classroom, I actively participate in technical workshops and open-source contributions, consistently maintaining a high academic standard while applying theoretical concepts to practical, hands-on programming challenges.</p>
